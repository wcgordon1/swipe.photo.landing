## Overview

Helio Grid needed a bold identity and a web presence to explain a new model for trading distributed solar. We built a confident brand story, a flexible landing framework, and motion studies that visualized power moving across neighborhoods.

## Objectives

- Name the marketplace and codify its voice and tone.
- Design a launch-ready marketing site that could scale into product pages.
- Create motion language that conveys energy transfer without cliché.

## Approach

We ran naming sprints, developed a geometric logomark, and designed a website with modular storytelling blocks. Subtle motion cues guided readers through the energy flow, while a dark-luminous palette gave the brand a distinct posture.

## Results

- Final name and identity approved across founder and investor groups.
- Launch kit packaged for in-house marketing team.
- Motion studies now inform the upcoming product UI work.
