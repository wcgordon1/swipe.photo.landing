## Overview

Reverie came to us with a common problem: **their brand was scaling faster than their identity**.  
We rebuilt their entire visual language, redesigned their website, and implemented a modular design system that could scale across all their channels.

## Objectives

- Rebuild the identity around clarity, calmness, and premium quality.  
- Increase conversion on product pages.  
- Create a CMS-powered site that the marketing team could update without developers.

## The Identity System

We built a flexible identity system using a neutral core palette, expressive typographic pairings, and a photography direction centered around softness and natural light.

## The Website

The new site is powered by **Astro + Tailwind**, optimized for speed, and built with reusable content modules for rapid iteration.

## Results

- +42% increase in conversion  
- 1.1s homepage load time  
- Deployed across 5 European markets
