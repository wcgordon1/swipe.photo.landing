## Overview

Mesa Health asked us to reduce churn in their patient portal and give clinicians a clearer view of daily capacity. We redesigned the entire experience, from appointment booking to post-visit follow-up, with a focus on clarity and accessibility.

## Objectives

- Simplify the patient booking flow and reduce drop-off.
- Give clinicians a unified dashboard for scheduling and messages.
- Establish a design ops cadence the internal team could maintain.

## Approach

We led research sprints with patients and staff, mapped the service journey, and rebuilt the interface with strong visual hierarchy and WCAG-focused components. We paired the redesign with a Storybook-driven UI kit to keep engineering velocity high.

## Results

- Early beta shows a 21% decrease in booking abandonment.
- Provider teams report faster triage with consolidated messaging.
- Design ops rituals now run in-house without agency support.
