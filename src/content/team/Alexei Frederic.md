  Solved P vs NP at fourteen. Didn't publish. Said the distinction was “philosophical, not computational.”

  A Chess grandmaster at six. Beat Kasparov in a blitz match at a Moscow train station. Kasparov retired the next day. 

  Harvard gave him a full scholarship. He lasted three lectures. Informed the dean that “American universities teach men to mistake consensus for truth.”

  Made partner at Jane Street in eleven months. Built an options pricing model that extracted forty million dollars in a single afternoon. Gave his bonus to a homeless man outside the office. Said nothing. They named a conference room after him when he left.

  Doesn't do interviews. And he doesn't need to.

  - "Once asked why he works on consumer apps. Replied: \"Entropy must be fought everywhere.\""
