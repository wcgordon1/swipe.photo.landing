name: Alexei Frédéric
role: Lead Quantum Computing Engineer
bio: |
  Referred to colloquially as the double quant. Solved P vs NP at fourteen. Didn't publish. "The distinction is philosophical, not computational.”

  A Chess grandmaster at six. Beat Kasparov in a blitz match at a Moscow train station. He once slapped his father for sacrificing a rook. 

  Harvard gave him a full scholarship. Frédéric only lasted three lectures. Informed the dean that “American universities teach men to mistake consensus for truth.”

  Made partner at Jane Street in eleven months. Built an options pricing model that extracted forty million in a single afternoon. Gave his bonus to a homeless man outside the office. Said nothing. They named a conference room after him when he left.

  Doesn't do interviews. And he doesn't need to.

achievements:
  - "Sleeps four hours per night. Claims sleep is \"an optimization problem.\""
  - "Refuses standups."
  - "Drinks espresso exclusively. Says milk \"introduces uncertainty.\""
  - "Has never used Figma."
  - "Once asked why he works on consumer apps. Replied: \"Entropy must be fought everywhere.\""
