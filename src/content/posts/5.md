Animation should explain what changed and where to look. If a user can’t answer those two questions, the motion is noise.

## Start with intent

- Use entry/exit motion to show hierarchy (primary first, secondary staggered).
- Keep durations short: 150–250ms for small UI, 300–450ms for overlays.

## Accessibility matters

- Respect reduced-motion preferences; swap transitions for fades or instant states.
- Avoid parallax or large translations that can induce motion sickness.

## Helpful defaults

- Easing: use `ease-out` for entrances, `ease-in` for exits, and `ease-in-out` for subtle loops.
- Limit bounces and overshoots; clarity beats flair.
