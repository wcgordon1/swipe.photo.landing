Perfect accessibility takes time, but a few focused checks catch most blockers before launch.

## Keyboard first

- Every link and button should be reachable and clearly focused.
- Keep focus outlines visible; avoid removing them without a high-contrast replacement.

## Contrast and copy

- Test text and primary buttons for WCAG AA contrast.
- Use clear labels on form fields—placeholders aren’t substitutes.

## Media and semantics

- Provide alt text for key images; mark decorative visuals as empty alt.
- Use semantic tags (`nav`, `main`, `button`, `label`) so assistive tech reads structure correctly.
