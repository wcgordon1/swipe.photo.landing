A responsive grid should feel invisible—content flows without forcing users to notice the layout. Start with a base column count (12 is common) and scale down with predictable breakpoints.

## Grid fundamentals

- Keep column gutters consistent; swap to larger gutters on wide screens to avoid crowded text.
- Set max-content widths so lines don’t stretch endlessly on desktops.
- Use fractional columns (e.g., 3/12, 6/12) so components snap cleanly when stacking.

## Breakpoints that matter

- Mobile: collapse to a single column; protect headline hierarchy and CTA spacing.
- Tablet: two columns for cards and split layouts; reduce hero text size slightly.
- Desktop: three or four columns max—too many columns dilute focus.

## Quick checks

- Do cards align on the same baseline after wrapping?
- Are CTAs still prominent when the layout stacks?
- Are images using consistent ratios to prevent layout jumps?
