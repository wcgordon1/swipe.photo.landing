Microcopy is the quiet voice in your interface—tooltips, helper text, and button labels that decide whether users keep moving or bounce.

## Keep it specific

- Replace vague buttons like “Submit” with intent (“Send request”, “Save changes”).
- Clarify consequences near the action (e.g., “Sends a confirmation email”).

## Reduce friction

- Add inline hints for formats (“Use work email”, “At least 8 characters”).
- Surface next steps after a form completes so momentum continues.



## Tone guidelines

- Active voice, present tense.
- Short sentences; skip filler like “please note”.
- Consistency beats cleverness—match labels across the product.
