Composition is the backbone of web design—how elements are arranged, spaced, and related to one another dictates whether a page feels effortless or overwhelming. When composition is intentional, users know where to look, what to do, and why they should care.

## Why composition matters

- Guides attention so users see the right thing at the right time.
- Builds trust through visual consistency and clear hierarchy.
- Improves readability and comprehension for longer-form content.
- Creates focus, reducing cognitive load on complex pages.

## Core principles to lean on

1. **Hierarchy first.** Decide the single most important action or message, then scale size, weight, and contrast accordingly. Headlines, calls-to-action, and primary navigation should visibly outrank secondary elements.
2. **Rhythm through spacing.** Use consistent spacing tokens and vertical rhythm to establish flow. Treat spacing like a grid, not a guessing game.
3. **Alignment for stability.** Snap content to a baseline grid and align edges; misaligned cards or buttons create instant friction.
4. **Contrast with purpose.** Pair bold with subtle: heavy type with light body copy, saturated accents with neutral surfaces.
5. **Containment and framing.** Cards, panels, and subtle backgrounds create clear regions and help users scan faster.

## Applying classical techniques to the web

- **Rule of thirds:** Position hero focal points (headline, primary button, key visual) near intersection points to create immediate interest.
- **Golden ratio cues:** Use 1:1.618 ratios for hero splits or content/sidebar widths to keep layouts feeling balanced without strict symmetry.
- **Leading lines:** Arrows, angled backgrounds, or staggered card edges can guide the eye toward CTAs.
- **Negative space:** Give breathing room around primary actions; crowded CTAs reduce clicks by blending into surrounding noise.

## A practical layout checklist

### Hero sections
- One job: communicate the core value and a single CTA.
- Anchor headline, subhead, and button on a common left edge; let supporting art balance the opposite side.
- Use contrast: light background with bold type, or dark overlay on imagery with bright buttons.

### Content blocks
- Keep a consistent column grid; avoid random widths between blocks.
- Group related content with shared backgrounds or borders; separate unrelated items with generous padding.
- Limit each section to one main idea; add a clear heading that matches the content beneath it.

### Cards and lists
- Align titles, meta info, and actions vertically; avoid jagged text starts.
- Use consistent image ratios to prevent layout jumpiness.
- Provide predictable hover states and a single, clear click target.

### Typography
- Set body text between 16–18px with 1.5–1.7 line height for comfortable reading.
- Use a clear hierarchy: H1 (hero), H2 (section), H3 (sub-section). Avoid skipping levels.
- Keep line length in check: 55–75 characters for paragraphs; shorter for pull quotes.

### Color and contrast
- Build a palette around 1–2 accent colors plus neutrals. Overusing accents dilutes hierarchy.
- Test contrast on primary buttons and body text to meet accessibility (WCAG AA) targets.
- Use color to reinforce meaning: warnings, success states, or active nav items.

## How to iterate quickly

1. **Wireframe first.** Block shapes and spacing before polishing; if the wireframe reads clearly, the final UI will too.
2. **Print the page in grayscale.** If hierarchy still reads without color, your composition is solid.
3. **Test one change at a time.** Adjust spacing scale or heading weight separately to see which shift improves clarity.
4. **Get real content early.** Placeholder copy hides hierarchy issues; real words expose them fast.

## Example composition patterns

- **Split hero:** Text column (40–45%) + visual (55–60%) with aligned baseline for headline and CTA.
- **Z-pattern scan:** Headline top-left, hero image top-right, features mid-left, CTA bottom-right.
- **F-pattern content:** Strong left alignment with subheads and pull quotes as anchors down the page.
- **Card grid:** Three-up on desktop, two-up on tablet, single column on mobile with consistent gutters.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Equal-weight CTAs fighting for attention.
- Inconsistent padding between sections, making the page feel stitched together.
- Misaligned baselines between text and buttons.
- Overuse of drop shadows instead of structural spacing and alignment.

## Quick start: upgrade an existing page

1. Identify the single primary action; demote or remove competing buttons.
2. Align hero text and CTA to one edge; tighten or expand spacing using a 4–8–12px scale.
3. Normalize card widths and image ratios; ensure consistent heading sizes across sections.
4. Add whitespace around the primary CTA and keep surrounding elements quieter in color and weight.

Composition isn’t decoration—it’s the silent logic that makes a page effortless to use. Nail hierarchy, spacing, and alignment, and every subsequent design decision becomes faster, clearer, and easier to defend.
