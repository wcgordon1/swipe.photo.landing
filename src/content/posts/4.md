A good palette scales: one accent, a set of neutrals, and semantic colors for states. Name tokens by function, not hue—`accent/primary`, `surface/raised`, `text/muted`.

## Build the core

- Choose one main accent and a calm secondary; avoid competing loud colors.
- Define neutrals from background to foreground (e.g., surface, panel, border, text).

## Semantics over shades

- Map states (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`) with accessible contrast.
- Keep hover/active states lighter or darker by a consistent step.

## Guardrails

- Limit accent usage to links, CTAs, and highlights.
- Test dark-on-light and light-on-dark combinations early to prevent rework.
