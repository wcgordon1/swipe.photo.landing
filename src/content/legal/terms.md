# Terms of Use — Swipe.Photo

**Effective date:** 2026-01-22

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Swipe.Photo website and mobile application (together, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

---

## 1) Who we are

“Swipe.Photo,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the operator of the Swipe.Photo website and app.

**Contact:** support@starterbuild.com

---

## 2) What Swipe.Photo does

Swipe.Photo helps you review photos on your iPhone and swipe to keep or delete them. The Service is meant for personal use and convenience.

Swipe.Photo is not a cloud storage service. We do not provide photo backup or recovery services.

---

## 3) Eligibility

You must be able to form a legally binding contract in your jurisdiction to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority where you live, you may use the Service only with permission from a parent or legal guardian.

---

## 4) Your responsibilities

You agree to use the Service in a lawful and responsible way.

You are responsible for:
- How you use the Service
- Any photos you choose to keep or delete
- Maintaining your own backups (if you want them)

**Important:** Deleting photos may be permanent (especially after you remove them from “Recently Deleted” in iOS). Please use the Service carefully.

---

## 5) Photos and device access

To function, Swipe.Photo may request permission to access your Photos library.

- Your photos remain on your device.
- You control permissions in iOS Settings.
- You understand that deleting photos is an action performed on your device using Apple’s photo frameworks.

We are not responsible for data loss caused by user actions, device settings, iOS behavior, third-party apps, or hardware issues.

---

## 6) Purchases, subscriptions, and billing (if offered)

If Swipe.Photo offers paid features, purchases are processed through the Apple App Store (and may be managed using a subscription platform such as RevenueCat).

Billing terms:
- Prices may change in the future, but changes won’t affect active billing periods unless allowed by Apple’s rules.
- Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled through your Apple ID settings.
- Refunds, if available, are handled by Apple under Apple’s policies.

We do not handle or store your full payment details.

---

## 7) Acceptable use

You agree not to:
- Use the Service for unlawful purposes
- Attempt to interfere with, damage, or reverse engineer the Service
- Bypass security or access controls
- Use automated tools to scrape or overload the website
- Misrepresent Swipe.Photo or use our name in a misleading way

We can suspend or stop access to the Service if we believe you are misusing it.

---

## 8) Intellectual property

The Service (including the app, website, logo, text, design, and code) is owned by Swipe.Photo or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.

You are granted a limited, personal, non-transferable license to use the Service for its intended purpose. You may not copy, distribute, sell, or create derivative works from the Service except as allowed by law.

---

## 9) Third-party services

The Service may rely on third-party platforms (for example: Apple services, App Store payments, subscription management, analytics/crash reporting if used). Your use of those services may be subject to their terms and policies.

We are not responsible for third-party services.

---

## 10) Disclaimer (plain speak)

We provide the Service “as is” and “as available.”

We do our best to keep the Service stable and helpful, but we do not promise that:
- the Service will always work perfectly
- the Service will be error-free
- the Service will meet every user’s needs
- deleted photos can be recovered

To the maximum extent allowed by law, we disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

---

## 11) Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent allowed by law:
- Swipe.Photo is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.
- Swipe.Photo is not liable for lost profits, lost data, or loss of photos.
- Our total liability for any claim relating to the Service will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) to use the Service in the 12 months before the claim, or **$10** if you paid nothing.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so parts of this section may not apply to you.

---

## 12) Indemnification

If you misuse the Service or violate these Terms, you agree to indemnify and hold Swipe.Photo harmless from related claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees).

---

## 13) Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time.

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time if:
- we believe you are violating these Terms
- we are required to do so by law
- we discontinue the Service

Termination does not affect any rights or obligations that should survive termination (including intellectual property, disclaimers, and liability limits).

---

## 14) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the effective date at the top. Continuing to use the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

---

## 15) Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Swipe.Photo is operated (to be specified), without regard to conflict of laws rules.

If you want, replace this section with your preferred state/country (for example, Indiana or California).
