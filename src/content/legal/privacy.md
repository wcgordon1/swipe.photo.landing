# Privacy Policy — Swipe.Photo

**Effective date:** 2026-01-22

Swipe.Photo is a simple iPhone app for reviewing photos and swiping to keep or delete. We built it to work **without accounts** and without collecting personal information.

If you have questions, email: **support@starterbuild.com** 

---

## Summary (plain speak)

- We do **not** require a login.
- We do **not** collect or store your name, email, phone number, or contacts.
- Your photos stay on your device. We do **not** upload your photo library to our servers.
- Purchases (if any) are handled by Apple and our billing provider; we don’t get your full payment details.

---

## Information we collect

### Information you provide
**None.** Swipe.Photo does not have a signup or login, and we do not ask you to submit personal information.

### Photos and photo library access
Swipe.Photo needs permission to access your Photos so you can review your camera roll and delete photos.

- Photos are processed **on your device**.
- We do **not** view, store, or upload your photos to our servers.
- If you choose to delete a photo, that deletion happens through Apple’s Photos framework on your device.

You can remove photo access anytime in **iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Photos**.

### Device and app data (limited)
Like most apps, Swipe.Photo may receive limited technical data from Apple (and/or tools we use) to help the app work reliably, such as:
- crash reports
- basic device/app version information
- performance diagnostics

This information is used to fix bugs and improve stability, not to identify you.

---

## Purchases and subscriptions

If Swipe.Photo offers paid features:
- Purchases are processed by **Apple’s App Store**.
- We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions and entitlements.

We do not receive your full payment information (like your credit card number). Apple and/or RevenueCat may process purchase-related data in order to confirm your subscription status and prevent fraud.

---

## How we use information

If we receive limited technical data, we use it only to:
- keep the app working
- debug crashes
- improve performance and reliability

We do not use your data to build advertising profiles.

---

## Sharing your information

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share limited technical or purchase-related information only with:
- **Apple** (App Store and iOS services)
- **RevenueCat** (subscription management)

…and only for operating the app and providing purchases/subscriptions.

---

## Data retention

Swipe.Photo does not maintain user accounts, so we do not store personal profiles.

If we receive crash logs or diagnostics, those are retained only as long as needed for troubleshooting and improving the app.

---

## Your choices

- **Photo access:** You can change or revoke access in iOS Settings anytime.
- **Subscriptions:** You can manage or cancel subscriptions through your Apple ID subscription settings.

---

## Children’s privacy

Swipe.Photo is not designed to collect personal information from children. Since we do not collect personal information through the app, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

---

## Changes to this policy

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date above. If changes are significant, we’ll make a reasonable effort to notify users (for example, via an in-app notice or App Store update notes).
